# simplecapture
A web app for using your Chromebook/iPad/Mobile as a monitor for your Playstation or Xbox using a capture card plugged into your USB port, no extra software is required, and uses your built in browser to capture and display the feed. 

I have hosted it at [simplecapture.space](simplecapture.space) for convenience, but if you want you can download the index.html from this repository, save it somewhere easily accessible and just open that file in your browser (chrome/chrome based is recommended) for offline use :)
